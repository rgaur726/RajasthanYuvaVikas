                        <h6 id = "a">“A community of 100 teenage role models from across the state”
</h6>
                        <p>
                            Imagine a cadre of young leaders, boys and girls who have started initiatives or transformed their communities before the age of 20—in most cases, before they leave high school. Among other characteristics, successful leaders typically start early: and these early life experiences help them go on to become leaders in their fields. 
By identifying and recognizing outstanding individuals under the age of 20 who led change around them, RYV 100 is setting up role models and investing in inspiring teenagers to trigger a movement of young people around the state to begin their journey of critical learning along a changemaker pathway. </p><p>
These teenage role models will create positive impact around them by <ul style="list-style-type:disc" id="ab"> <li> inspire other students around them</li>  Exhibiting clear set of values </li><li> demonstrating commitment to community </li> </ul> </p> <p>
They illustrate for youth a way of achieving successful goals and a sense of self-worth. </p><p>
We believe that society will benefit from an expanded and self-aware group of such talent, drawn from all segments of state populations and focused on innovations that address the full range of our social and environmental challenges. Moreover, by recognizing these future leaders, we can enhance their educational and career opportunities. Colleges and universities will be keen to enroll these role models, including providing scholarships for those who need them. Later on, employers will seek to hire future leaders who are demonstrated innovators. And as Youth Innovators become leaders, they will help to transform their communities, their organizations, and their countries.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Through its student chapters, RYV endeavors to equip the students at schools & colleges to the power of entrepreneurial thinking & skills in the evolving global landscape which is fast embracing this idea of a 'new capitalism'. RYV Student chapters are led by students of the respective institutions and organize various activities throughout the year. The sessions have a hands-on, activity based pedagogy ably supported by partner organisations.
</p><p>
The chapter activities, which run under a problem solving and analytical framework, are adaptable to include live problems of organizations who can get novel and innovative ideas from an engaged class of young talent from various schools & colleges. The intent for RYV is to introduce students to social problems and teach them how to design sustainable solutions for problems around them. At the heart of this approach is RYV's volunteer team of creative and strong facilitators which includes entrepreneurs and academicians from across the state.
</p><p>
We foresee synergies with several stakeholders in this ecosystem including colleges which want to expose students to entrepreneurial program at their college, schools to start Entrepreneurship clubs at your institute. We welcome the opportunity to discuss with academic institutes the possible ways in which we can collaborate and are open to various forms of engagement.
